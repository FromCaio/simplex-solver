# A Linear Programming Problem that requires Phase I (dual-phase Simplex).
# Maximize P = 2x_1 + 3x_2
# Subject to:
#   x_1 +  x_2 >= 4        → requires artificial variable
#   2x_1 + 5x_2 <= 15      → slack variable only
#   4x_1 + 3x_2 = 18       → requires artificial variable
#
# This LP needs dual-phase Simplex because of the >= and = constraints.

NUM_VARS: 2
